# USF SOAR General Organization Chart

This is a slightly more complex, modifed version of the basic [Google Organization Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/orgchart). It is still powered by our position database in Google Sheets and the Google Charts library, but has extra information when compared to the organization chart embedded in that sheet. This chart shows who holds each position, which ones are open, and has filters for ease of use.
